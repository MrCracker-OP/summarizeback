**Note: It's recommended to create the virtual environment (venv) within the project directory. To do so, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command and then proceed with the following instructions.**

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

#### Windows

```bash
python -m venv dev
dev\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux
```bash
python -m venv dev
source dev/bin/activate
```

### Install dependencies after you have setup the Virtual Environment
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
